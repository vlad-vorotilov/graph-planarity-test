# Left-right planarity test implemetation in C++
[Left-right planarity test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_planarity_test) is graph algorithm with `O(number of edges)` time complexity.

This algorithm was implemented as an assignment for Data Visualization Methods course taught by [Alex Dainiak](https://github.com/dainiak) in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 2016.

This code is free to use for anyone for any purposes.
